# whatsapp-message-scheduler-cli
 This is the final project in the completion of the Skaehub Bootcamp
 
# 1.problem 
Build a CLI app to schedule whatsapp messages and send them automatically once the scheduled time has passed. For example, your app should prompt the user to write a message, their whatsapp number, the recipientâ€™s number and the time they intend to have it sent out. You can save this data on an SQLite Database.

# 2.general purpose
The general purpose of the application is to enable the user to be able to schedule meessages at ease incase they are not able to do it at that specific time.The application allows the user to enter recepient number and message to be sent at that specific scheduled time

# 3.How it works
The program utilises Twilio API for Whatsaapp to only send messages and Python 's in-built libraries like datetime and time to schedule the messages.
